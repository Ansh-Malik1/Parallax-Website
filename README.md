# Parallax-Website
This is a parallax website made using HTML and CSS.
A parallax website is a website in which images in foreground move faster than the images in background.
This creates a 'depth' like effect in 2D and looks good if well executed.
In this website, the main(hero) section is made using paralllax tecnique. As you scroll down, you will see the person in foreground moves faster than
the mountains in the background.
The other sections of the website are also good lopking and modern.
This concept can be further used in other complex designs to make once's website stand out than the others.

This effect is given mainly by two CSS properties :
1. Perspective
2. Z-index
